║    1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.                               ║
║    2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.                               ║
║       Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.                                  ║
║    3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) ║
║       is the winner.                                                                            ║
║    4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row,         ║
║       the game ends in a tie.                                                                   ║
